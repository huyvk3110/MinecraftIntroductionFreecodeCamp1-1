            Minecraft received critical acclaim and won numerous awards, and has been described as one of the most
            influential and greatest video games in history. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the
            MineCon convention played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational
            environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have
            been built in it. It is the single best-selling video game of all time, selling over 176 million copies
            across all platforms by late 2019, while having over 112 million monthly active players. A number of
            spin-off games have also been developed, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft
            Dungeons.
